G14.2_2884788726_2	However, in information-centric networking (ICN) the end-to-end encryption makes the content caching ineffective since encrypted content stored in a cache is useless for any consumer except those who know the encryption key.	"1. End-to-end encryption
2. Content caching
3. Encryption key
4. Ineffective
5. Consumer"	"1. End-to-end encryption: A security measure that ensures only the sender and intended recipient can access the content of a communication, by encrypting it at the source and decrypting it only at the destination.
2. Content caching: A technique used to store frequently accessed content in a network closer to the user, reducing the time it takes to load and improving performance.
3. Encryption key: A unique sequence of bits used to encrypt and decrypt data, ensuring that only authorized parties can access the content.
4. Ineffective: (adjective) Lacking the desired or intended effect, often due to inadequate planning, resources, or execution.
5. Consumer: (noun) An individual or organization that purchases or uses goods or services, often for personal or business purposes."
G17.2_2893955699_1	Concatenated Greenberger‚ÄìHorne‚ÄìZeilinger (C-GHZ) state is a kind of logic qubit which is robust in noisy environment.	"1. Concatenated
2. Greenberger
3. Horne
4. Zeilinger
5. logic qubit"	"1. Concatenated: A concatenated sequence of quantum states is a sequence of states that are combined by taking their tensor product.
2. Greenberger: Greenberger is a quantum state that is used as a resource for quantum teleportation, a process that allows for the transfer of a quantum state from one location to another without physical transport of the state.
3. Horne: Horne is a quantum state that is used in quantum teleportation, similar to Greenberger.
4. Zeilinger: Zeilinger is a quantum state that is used in quantum teleportation, similar to Greenberger and Horne.
5. Logic qubit: A logic qubit is a type of qubit that can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1 at the same time, allowing for the representation of both classical logical values (0 or 1) in a quantum system."
G17.4_2974627365_1	Quantum circuits for arithmetic functions over Galois fields such as squaring are required to implement quantum cryptanalysis algorithms.	"1. Quantum circuits
2. Galois fields
3. Squaring
4. Cryptanalysis
5. Algorithms"	"1. Quantum circuits: A set of quantum gates that are connected in a specific sequence to perform a quantum computation.
2. Galois fields: A mathematical structure used in cryptography to construct cryptographic primitives, such as finite fields and their algebraic operations.
3. Squaring: A mathematical operation that takes an element of a finite field and returns the element itself raised to the power of 2.
4. Cryptanalysis: The study of methods for breaking or weakening cryptographic algorithms, including attacks on the security of cryptographic systems.
5. Algorithms: A set of instructions used to solve a particular problem or perform a specific task, often in a computer system or program."
T19.2_2172121104_3	The XECGA is then used to build the probabilistic model and to sample a new population based on the probabilistic model.	"1. XECGA
                    2. probabilistic model
                    3. sample
                    4. population
                    5. probabilistic"	"1. XECGA: A XECGA (eXtreme Gradient Boosting Algorithm) is a machine learning algorithm that combines multiple weak models to create a strong predictive model.
2. Probabilistic model: A probabilistic model is a statistical model that assigns a probability distribution to each possible outcome or value of a variable, allowing for the estimation of uncertainty and risk.
3. Sample: A sample is a subset of data selected from a larger population, used to represent the population or to make inferences about it.
4. Population: A population is the entire set of individuals or cases that a study or analysis is based on, from which a sample is typically selected.
5. Probabilistic: Probabilistic refers to the use of probability theory and statistical methods to analyze and model uncertain phenomena, such as the probability of an event occurring or the probability of a particular value of a variable."
G07.2_1917985537_2	Treating search engines as editorial products with intrinsic biases can help understand the structure of information flows in new media.	"1. Intrinsic biases
2. Information flows
3. New media
4. Editorial products
5. Structures"	"1. Intrinsic biases: Unconscious or unintentional biases that are inherent in the design of a system, algorithm, or process, which can influence the results or outcomes.
2. Information flows: The movement of data, information, or knowledge between different entities, systems, or individuals, often through various channels or pathways.
3. New media: Digital or online platforms, tools, or technologies that enable new forms of communication, interaction, or expression, such as social media, blogs, or podcasts.
4. Editorial products: Content created or curated by editors, such as articles, videos, or podcasts, that are intended to inform, educate, or entertain a specific audience.
5. Structures: The underlying organizational or architectural frameworks that shape the way information is collected, stored, or disseminated, such as databases, data warehouses, or content management systems."
T15.1_2952002252_3	To achieve this, some organisations ‚Äúpentest‚Äù their employees, testing their resilience and ability to detect and repel human-targeted attacks.	"1. Resilience
2. Pentest
3. Human-targeted attacks
4. Repel
5. Detect"	"1. Resilience: The ability of an organization or system to withstand or recover quickly from disruptions, attacks, or failures.
2. Pentest: A simulated cyber attack against a computer system, network, or web application to test its defenses and identify vulnerabilities.
3. Human-targeted attacks: Cyber attacks that target individuals, such as phishing, social engineering, or spear phishing, to gain unauthorized access to their personal information or systems.
4. Repel: To prevent or defend against a cyber attack or intrusion, often through the use of security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, or antivirus software.
5. Detect: To identify or discover a cyber attack or intrusion, often through the use of security measures such as intrusion detection systems, log analysis, or security information and event management (SIEM) systems."

G14.2_2884788726_2	"However, in information-centric networking (ICN) the end-to-end encryption makes the content caching ineffective since encrypted content stored in a cache is useless for any consumer except those who know the encryption key."	"1. End-to-end encryption
2. Information-centric networking (ICN)"	"1. End-to-end encryption: End-to-end encryption is a security method that scrambles data in a way that only the sender and intended recipient can unscramble it, ensuring that no one in between, including hackers or internet service providers, can read or access the information.

2. Information-centric networking (ICN): Information-centric networking (ICN) is a type of internet architecture that prioritizes the discovery, sharing, and management of digital content, rather than just focusing on the devices or networks that carry it, allowing for more efficient and secure data exchange."
G17.2_2893955699_1	Concatenated Greenberger‚ÄìHorne‚ÄìZeilinger (C-GHZ) state is a kind of logic qubit which is robust in noisy environment.	"1. Concatenated Greenberger‚ÄìHorne‚ÄìZeilinger
2. Logic qubit"	"1. Concatenated Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state: A type of quantum entanglement where multiple particles are connected in a way that allows their properties to be correlated across vast distances, enabling the transfer of information in a secure and potentially un-hackable manner.
2. Logic qubit: A fundamental unit of quantum information that can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing it to process information in ways that are beyond the capabilities of classical computers, such as performing calculations on vast amounts of data simultaneously."
G17.4_2974627365_1	Quantum circuits for arithmetic functions over Galois fields such as squaring are required to implement quantum cryptanalysis algorithms.	"1. Galois fields
2. Quantum circuits"	"1. Galois fields: A Galois field is a mathematical structure that's like a special kind of arithmetic where numbers can be added and multiplied, but with a twist: it's finite, meaning it only has a certain number of values, and it's used in coding theory and cryptography to create secure messages.
2. Quantum circuits: A quantum circuit is a theoretical framework that uses the strange properties of quantum mechanics to process information in a way that's faster and more powerful than classical computers, by manipulating tiny particles called qubits to perform calculations and solve complex problems."
T19.2_2172121104_3	The XECGA is then used to build the probabilistic model and to sample a new population based on the probabilistic model.	"1. XECGA
2. Probabilistic model"	"1. XECGA: XECGA stands for Cross-Evidence Consistency Graph Attention, which is a type of artificial intelligence technique used to analyze and understand complex relationships between different pieces of information, such as text, images, and audio.
2. Probabilistic model: A probabilistic model is a mathematical framework that uses numbers and statistics to predict the likelihood of different outcomes or events, allowing us to make informed decisions and understand complex systems by quantifying uncertainty and risk."
G07.2_1917985537_2	Treating search engines as editorial products with intrinsic biases can help understand the structure of information flows in new media.	"1. Intrinsic biases
2. Editorial products"	"1. Intrinsic biases: Intrinsic biases refer to the automatic and often unconscious attitudes or beliefs that we hold towards certain groups of people, things, or ideas, which can influence our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in subtle but significant ways.

2. Editorial products: Editorial products are the written, visual, or audio content created by journalists, writers, and other media professionals to inform, entertain, or persuade audiences, which are often shaped by the perspectives, values, and agendas of their creators."
T15.1_2952002252_3	"To achieve this, some organisations ‚Äúpentest‚Äù their employees, testing their resilience and ability to detect and repel human-targeted attacks."	"1. Pentest
2. Resilience"	"1. Pentest: A pentest, short for penetration test, is a simulated cyber attack on a computer system or network to test its defenses and identify vulnerabilities before real hackers can exploit them.
2. Resilience: Resilience refers to the ability of a system, organization, or individual to withstand and recover from disruptions, shocks, or crises, such as natural disasters, economic downturns, or cyber attacks, by adapting and bouncing back stronger and more robust."
